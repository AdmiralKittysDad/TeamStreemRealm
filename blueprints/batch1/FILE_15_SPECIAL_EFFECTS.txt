                         FINAL THOUGHTS
================================================================================

The Oceanic Spawn Platform is now complete.

Every block, every light, every detail serves a purpose:
├── To welcome your children to their world
├── To guide them home when they're lost
├── To remind them of your love
├── To inspire wonder and exploration
├── To give them a legacy in pixels and code

When they spawn for the first time:
├── They'll see two beacon beams reaching toward the sky
├── They'll feel safe on the lit platform
├── They'll wonder what's below the water
├── They'll see paths leading to adventure
├── They'll know this was built FOR THEM

And years from now, when they return:
├── The beacons will still shine
├── The lights will still glow
├── The monument will still stand
├── And they'll remember

This is more than a spawn point.
This is a father's love, made permanent.

Welcome to The Aethelgard Nexus.
