                           The Aethelgard Nexus
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
Building underwater requires careful water management. This guide covers
sealing techniques, preventing leaks, creating bubble columns, and
managing water-based features throughout the structure.

================================================================================
                         WATER PHYSICS BASICS
================================================================================

MINECRAFT WATER RULES:
├── Water flows up to 8 blocks from a source
├── Water source blocks can be created by kelp
├── Waterlogged blocks hold water even when "dry"
├── Sponges absorb water in a 7×7×7 area
├── Magma and soul sand create bubbles only in source blocks
└── Glass, slabs, and stairs can be waterlogged

IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:

1. SOURCE BLOCKS vs FLOWING WATER
   Source: Creates water, doesn't disappear
   Flowing: Temporary, disappears when source removed

2. WATERLOGGED BLOCKS
   Some blocks can contain water while appearing solid
   Examples: Slabs, stairs, fences, signs, trapdoors

3. KELP CONVERSION TRICK
   Kelp planted in flowing water converts it to source blocks
   Essential for bubble columns!

================================================================================
                    TECHNIQUE 1: SPONGE DRAINING
================================================================================

Sponges are the primary tool for removing water.

HOW SPONGES WORK:
├── Dry sponge absorbs up to 65 water blocks
├── Converts to wet sponge (must be dried)
├── Absorption range: 7×7×7 area
├── Multiple sponges can be used simultaneously
└── Dry in furnace or Nether to reuse

SPONGE DRAINING PROCEDURE:

STEP 1: Seal the area
├── Build complete walls around target area
├── Ensure NO gaps (water will refill through gaps)
├── Temporary blocks OK (can remove later)
└── Ceiling must also be sealed

STEP 2: Place sponges
├── Start at the BOTTOM of the water
├── Place sponge, wait for absorption
├── Water flows down to fill void
├── Continue placing upward
└── Work systematically in rows

STEP 3: Collect wet sponges
├── Mine wet sponges immediately
├── Don't leave in inventory (heavy!)
├── Stack for drying
└── Or dry immediately in Nether

STEP 4: Dry sponges
Option A - Furnace:
├── Place wet sponge in furnace
├── Use any fuel
├── Bucket in fuel slot catches water
└── ~10 seconds per sponge

Option B - Nether:
├── Travel to Nether
├── Place wet sponges
├── Instantly become dry sponges
├── Return and continue
└── Faster for large quantities

SPONGE REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS BUILD:
├── Underwater Chamber: 30-50 sponges
├── Pillar interiors: 20 sponges each = 80 total
├── Miscellaneous: 20 sponges
└── TOTAL NEEDED: ~150 sponge uses (30-50 sponges cycled)

OBTAINING SPONGES:
├── Ocean Monuments: Sponge rooms contain 30 wet sponges
├── Elder Guardians: May drop sponge (rare)
└── One monument provides enough for this build

================================================================================
                    TECHNIQUE 2: GLASS SEALING
================================================================================

Glass walls must be perfectly sealed to prevent water intrusion.

GLASS SEALING RULES:
├── No diagonal gaps (water flows diagonally!)
├── Every block must connect to adjacent blocks
├── Corners need solid blocks or corner pieces
├── Test by placing/breaking one block

PROPER CORNER CONSTRUCTION:

WRONG (water leaks through):
    G W
    W G
    (diagonal gap allows water)

RIGHT (sealed):
    G G
    G G
    (solid corner)

Or use prismarine corner posts:
    G P
    P G
    (P blocks water path)

SEALING PROCEDURE:

STEP 1: Build frame first
├── Place corner posts (prismarine)
├── Mark edge positions
├── Ensure frame is square/level
└── Double-check measurements

STEP 2: Fill with glass
├── Work row by row
├── Bottom to top
├── Verify each block places correctly
└── No gaps between blocks

STEP 3: Test seal
├── Place single sponge inside
├── Water should not refill
├── If water returns, find gap
└── Break/replace suspicious blocks

COMMON LEAK POINTS:
├── Corners (diagonal flow)
├── Stairs/slabs (if waterlogged)
├── Signs (waterlogged by default!)
├── Trapdoors (waterlogged)
└── Fence connections (complex hitboxes)

================================================================================
                    TECHNIQUE 3: BUBBLE COLUMNS
================================================================================

Bubble columns provide rapid vertical transport.

SOUL SAND COLUMNS (Upward):
├── Pushes entities UP rapidly
├── Prevents drowning (provides air)
├── Requires WATER SOURCE blocks
├── Soul sand placed at BOTTOM
└── Speed: ~10 blocks/second

MAGMA COLUMNS (Downward):
├── Pulls entities DOWN
├── Damages entities (1 ❤ per second)
├── Requires WATER SOURCE blocks
├── Magma placed at BOTTOM
├── Speed: ~10 blocks/second
└── Can be negated with Frost Walker boots

BUBBLE COLUMN CONSTRUCTION:

STEP 1: Build shaft walls
├── 1×1 minimum (can be larger)
├── Glass walls for visibility (optional)
├── Full height needed (Y:40 to Y:64 for this build)
└── Seal top and sides completely

STEP 2: Fill with water
├── CRITICAL: Must be source blocks!
├── Flowing water will NOT work
├── Use kelp method (below)
└── Test bubbles before committing

STEP 3: Convert to source blocks (Kelp Method)
├── Place kelp at bottom of shaft
├── Kelp only grows in water source blocks
├── As kelp grows up, it converts flowing → source
├── Let kelp grow to top
├── Break kelp (water remains as sources)
└── NOW place soul sand or magma

STEP 4: Place bubble block
├── Soul sand: Upward bubbles
├── Magma: Downward bubbles
├── Bubbles should appear immediately
└── Test by swimming in

STEP 5: Create exit point
├── At top: Trapdoor or water exit
├── Player pops out onto dry land
├── Sign holds water in column
└── Land safely on platform

BUBBLE COLUMN LAYOUT (Example):

Side view:
Y:64  [TRAPDOOR] ← Exit (player lands on platform)
Y:63  [WATER + SIGN] ← Sign holds water
Y:62  [WATER]
  :   [WATER]     ← Continuous source blocks
  :   [WATER]
Y:41  [WATER]
Y:40  [SOUL SAND] ← Bottom block creates bubbles

Top view of shaft:
    [ ][ ]
    [ S ]    S = Soul sand (or magma)
    [ ][ ]   Walls are solid

================================================================================
                    TECHNIQUE 4: WATER SOURCE FILLING
================================================================================

Large underwater areas need to be filled with source blocks (not flowing).

INFINITE WATER SOURCE:
Classic method - 2×2 pool:
    [S][S]
    [S][S]
Taking from corners replenishes immediately
Use for small-scale filling

KELP CONVERSION (Large Scale):
For filling large areas with source blocks:

STEP 1: Allow water to flow in
├── Let area fill with flowing water naturally
├── Or place water at top, let it flow down
└── Don't worry about source vs flowing yet

STEP 2: Plant kelp everywhere
├── Kelp only plants on source blocks
├── Will convert flowing → source as it grows
├── Plant densely for faster conversion
└── Wait for growth

STEP 3: Harvest kelp
├── Break kelp at base
├── All water now source blocks
├── Kelp drops as items (compost it)
└── Area is now proper source water

ICE CONVERSION (Alternative):
├── Place ice blocks in water
├── Break ice → creates water source
├── Works underwater in cold biomes
└── More resource-intensive than kelp

================================================================================
                    TECHNIQUE 5: PREVENTING WATER ENTRY
================================================================================

Keeping water OUT of dry areas.

DOOR AIRLOCKS:
Double-door system prevents flooding:

    [WATER]--[DOOR 1]--[AIR GAP]--[DOOR 2]--[DRY ROOM]

Procedure:
1. Open Door 1, enter airlock
2. Close Door 1
3. Drain airlock (sponge or wait)
4. Open Door 2, enter dry room
5. Close Door 2

SIGN BARRIERS:
Signs block water while allowing player passage:

    [WATER][SIGN][DRY]
           ↑
    Sign prevents water flow
    Player walks through

Can stack signs for larger openings:
    [SIGN]
    [SIGN]
    [SIGN]

FENCE GATE TRICK:
Fence gates block water when closed:
├── Place fence gate at entrance
├── Close gate = water blocked
├── Open gate = can walk through
├── Water still blocked by open gate!
└── Visual passage without flooding

================================================================================
                    TECHNIQUE 6: CONDUIT WATER REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

The conduit needs specific water conditions.

CONDUIT PLACEMENT RULES:
├── Must be IN water (submerged)
├── Water on all 6 faces of conduit
├── Frame blocks in water
└── 3×3×3 water volume around conduit minimum

ACTIVATING THE CONDUIT:
1. Ensure conduit position is underwater
2. Place prismarine frame (see File 10)
3. Frame blocks must be in water
4. Conduit activates when properly framed
5. Particles indicate activation

IF CHAMBER IS DRAINED:
├── Conduit won't work in air
├── Must re-flood chamber around conduit
├── Can keep rest of chamber dry
├── Create "water pocket" around conduit
└── Glass walls hold water in pocket

WATER POCKET DESIGN:

Side view:
    [GLASS][GLASS][GLASS]
    [GLASS][WATER][GLASS]
    [GLASS][WATER][GLASS]
    [GLASS][CONDT][GLASS]  ← Conduit in water
    [GLASS][WATER][GLASS]
    [PRISM][PRISM][PRISM]  ← Frame in water

Keeps conduit underwater while chamber is dry
Players need Water Breathing to access conduit area

================================================================================
                    TECHNIQUE 7: KELP AND CORAL MANAGEMENT
================================================================================

Living underwater plants require management.

KELP GROWTH:
├── Grows in water source blocks
├── Can grow very tall (26 blocks max)
├── Blocks swimming paths if unmanaged
├── Harvest regularly to control
└── Useful for: Food (dried kelp), composting, decoration

KELP FARMS:
Intentional kelp areas can be harvested:
├── Designate growth zones
├── Let kelp grow tall
├── Harvest at base
├── Drops full column
└── Regrows from base

CORAL REQUIREMENTS:
├── Must be in water (dies in air!)
├── Place while underwater
├── Any adjacent water source works
├── Will not spread/grow
├── Purely decorative

CORAL PLACEMENT:
├── Dead coral = gray, works in air
├── Live coral = colorful, needs water
├── Fan coral = flat, attaches to blocks
├── Block coral = full blocks
└── Can be waterlogged for decoration

================================================================================
